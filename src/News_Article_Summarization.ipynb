    "In this project, the aim is to create a system which will summarize the news articles from various sources such as BBC, CNN, NewYork Times, and etc. using one of the extractive text summarization approaches - <b><i>TextRank</i></b> algorithm into smaller texts which could be used by people for their own needs."

    "The data used for both text summarization and text classification tasks are news articles obtained from British Broadcasting Corporation News (BBC News) which were used by Greene and Cunningham in their work - Kernel Document Clustering. The data consisted of 2225 documents of news articles with their summaries for the period 2004-2005 under 5 different labels such as business, entertainment, politics, sports, and technology. We are taking input as text files (.txt)."

    "#### Theory and Methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "The text summarization is the process of providing concise and meaningful version of texts from various sources such as Twitter, Facebook, books and etc. There are two kinds of text summarization which are:\n",
    "* Extractive Text Summarization.\n",
    "* Abstractive Text Summarization.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<b><u>Extractive Text Summarization</u></b>: <br>\n",
    "This method generates summary based on using phrases and sentences from the given text. Hence, finding right sentences and phrases for a summary generation is an important task in this method. <br><br>\n",
    "<b><u>Abstractive Text Summarization</u></b>: <br>\n",
    "This method generates entirely new summary using Natural Language processing techniques. The tokens present in the generated summary may not be available in the given text.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, in this motebook, I am going to demonstrate the implementation of <b>Extractive Text Summarization</b> using <b>TextRank</b> algorithm and preserving <b> Abstractive Text Summarization</b> for performing comparative study between these two text summarization techniques for my master thesis. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### TextRank Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to have an understanding of <b>PageRank</b> algorithm before understanding TextRank algorithm because PageRank algorithm's working is similar to TextRank algorithm. PageRank algorithm's main purpose is to rank web pages based on the online search results. In order to rank the web pages, we need a <b>PageRank score</b> which is the probability of user visiting that web page. The scores are stored in a matrix of n X n dimension where n is the number of web pages.\n",
    "The score presented in the matrix representes the user's transistion from one page to another. Likewise, TextRank uses sentences to instead of web pages.\n",

The group\\'s quarterly survey of companies found exports had picked up in the last three months of 2004 to their best levels in eight years. The rise came despite exchange rates being cited as a major concern. However, the BCC found the whole UK economy still faced \"major risks\" and warned that growth is set to slow. It recently forecast economic growth will slow from more than 3% in 2004 to a little below 2.5% in both 2005 and 2006.  Manufacturers\\' domestic sales growth fell back slightly in the quarter, the survey of 5,196 firms found. Employment in manufacturing also fell and job expectations were at their lowest level for a year.  \"Despite some positive news for the export sector, there are worrying signs for manufacturing,\" the BCC said. \"These results reinforce our concern over the sector\\'s persistent inability to sustain recovery.\" The outlook for the service sector was \"uncertain\" despite an increase in exports and orders over the quarter, the BCC noted.  The BCC found confidence increased in the quarter across both the manufacturing and service sectors although overall it failed to reach the levels at the start of 2004. The reduced threat of interest rate increases had contributed to improved confidence, it said. The Bank of England raised interest rates five times between November 2003 and August last year. But rates have been kept on hold since then amid signs of falling consumer confidence and a slowdown in output. \"The pressure on costs and margins, the relentless increase in regulations, and the threat of higher taxes remain serious problems,\" BCC director general David Frost said. \"While consumer spending is set to decelerate significantly over the next 12-18 months, it is unlikely that investment and exports will rise sufficiently strongly to pick up the slack.\"'"
